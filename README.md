# Microservices Notes

Notes for the WIN program microservices quiz

## What are microservices? ## 

Microservices, or more specifically *microservices architecture*, is the arrangement of loosely coupled services that act as a singular application. An application structured with this architecture in mind will in fact be a collection of services. An individual service in this application may itself be referred to as a microservice.

Microservices are framed in contrast to *monolithic* applications -- or simply *monoliths*.
